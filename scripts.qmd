### Why this?

This page contains a collection of the interactive demonstrations written as playable [Marimo notebooks](https://docs.marimo.io). 

These examples are designed to complement analytical derivations in mass transfer, by turning mathematical models into interactive components.

### Examples in lecture notes

- [(L02) Comparison of diffusion / convection length scales](./scripts/L02_diffusion_length.html)
- [(L02) Comparison of diffusivity in gas / solid / liquid](./scripts/L02_diffusion_length.html)
- [(L03) Concentration profile in general solution of flux equation](./scripts/L03_xa_profile.html)


### Examples in assignments

- [(EX02) Plots for Q3 (choice of diffusivity model)](./scripts/EX02_codes.html)
