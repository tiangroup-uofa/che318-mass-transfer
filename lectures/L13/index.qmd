# Convective Mass Transfer

## Remaining Questions From Unsteady State Mass Transfer

Our current knowledge cannot answer questions like this:

- If chemical species A is transferred between two difference phases, what is the concentration in each phase?
- How do we solve the mass transfer when $c$ is not uniform? (See long answer question 2)
- What if fluid becomes turbulent?

## What We Want To Solve In Part II: A Real Engineering Problem

You work in a pipeline maintenance team in Enbridge and need to remove a sticky, unwanted coating from the inner wall of a pipeline. There are a few design questions:

- Which flushing liquid works best?
  - solvent / water mixture
  - solubility of the coating
- How fast should the fluid flow?
  - required mean velocity $v_m$
- What concentration remains in the liquid?
  - outlet concentration of the contaminant
- How fast is the coating removed?
  - removal rate vs. $v_m$

**What you want to report:**

- Total volume of flushing liquid required
- Total flushing time to reach acceptable cleanliness

## Mass Transfer Between Phases: Unsteady State Analysis

We will first look at the first problem, $c_A$ between phase
boundaries. This is something we _in theory_ can solve using U.S.S. But what are the boundary conditions?

Question: a polymer membrane of thickness $2Δ$ contains a chemical
with uniform concentration $c_0$ initially. At $t=0$, it is suddenly
submerged into a solution containing the same chemical with concentration $c_1$. The volume of liquid is very large that concentration remains $c_1$ far away from the membrane-liquid interface.
Model the concentration profile $c(z)$ inside the membrane, and calculate the total chemical absorption rate.

## Solving The Polymer Membrane Mass Transfer Problem

Use the standard procedure for the polymer phase, ignore convection inside

$$
D_{AB} \frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2} = \frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
$$

Initial conditions:

- Inside polymer $c_A(z, t=0) = c_0$
- Outside polymer $c_A(z, t=0) = c_1$

Boundary conditions?

- How do we know $c_A(z)$ at the interface?
- They can actually take any value!

## Realistic Interfacial Concentration Profiles

At the boundary, it is often convenient to use the equilibrium
concentration ratio between gas ($c_i$) and liquid ($c_{Li}$). This constant, often called the **equilibrium distribution coefficient**, is defined as:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
K &= \frac{\text{[Conc. at gas side]}}{\text{[Conc. at liquid side]}} \\
&= \frac{c_{i}}{c_{Li}}
\end{align}
```

- Similarity: Henry's law ($H = \dfrac{p_{\text{gas}}}{c_{\text{aq}}}$), remember in gas $p_{\text{gas}} = c_{\text{gas}} RT$
- We have already seen similar concepts in solubility in liquid / solid diffusion equations!
- $K$ can be a value range from $0$ to $\infty$ 👉 what does that mean?

## Interfacial Concentration Profile For Different $K$

- The interfacial concentration values depend on the value of $K$!
- What else determines the interfacial balance? 👉 matching of interfacial fluxes $N_A$ at both sides!

## Match of Interfacial Fluxes

**At equilibrium**, if there is no resistance when transferring A between the interface, what is the mass balance equation?

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{[In]}\vert_{\text{left}} - \text{[Out]}\vert_{\text{right}} + \text{[Gen]}\vert_{\text{interface}}
&= \text{[Acc]}\vert_{\text{interface}} \\
N_A\vert_{\text{left}} = N_A\vert_{\text{right}}
\end{align}
```

How do we model $N_A$ in each phase?

- May be a combination of diffusion and convection
- Fluid velocity at interface may be turbulent (hard to model)
- In general we use the phenomenal relation $\text{[Flux]} = \text{[Driving Force]} / \text{[Resistance]}$


## General Flux Equation For Convective Transport Regime

- The driving force is the concentration difference "bulk concentration" and "interfacial concentration"
- The resistance is lumped into one coefficient $k_c$, **mass transfer coefficient**.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A = k_c (c_{L, b} - c_{Li})
\end{align}
```
- $k_c$ is inversely related to the resistance.
- The unit of $k_c$?  👉  $\text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$
- $k_c$ can be $\infty$! 👉 No transfer resistance inside the bulk phase

## Where Does $k_c$ Come From?

Simplified view: transport resistance of A from bulk to the interface occurs inside an interfacial film with thickness
$\delta$. We can write $N_A$ at steady state using already known results

- Case 1: EMCD / diffusion-controlled / dilute transport in liquid

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{D_{AB}}{\delta}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

- Case 2: transport in stagnant film with non-negligible convection

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{D_{AB}}{\delta (1 - \frac{c}{c_T} )}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

One can expect $k_c$ may contain the $1/x_{Bm}$ term in Case 2!

## Where Does $k_c$ Come From?

The mass transfer coefficient $k_c$ is even valid for systems with effective $D_{AB}$!

- Case 3: mass transfer in porous solid materials

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{\epsilon}{\tau}\frac{D_{AB}}{\delta}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

- Case 4: turbulent mass transfer (to be discussed later)

The turbulence in the fluid contributes to an additional term $\epsilon_m$ in diffusion terms

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{D_{AB} + \epsilon_m}{\delta}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

## Implications of Mass Transfer Coefficient $k_c$

- Really convenient to use! 
- In reality, $k_c$ is not a physics-based quantity, it depends on system / condition
- $k_c \propto D_{AB}^n$ in realistic systems
- We will discuss about different theories that explains the relation between $k_c$ and $D_{AB}$ (penetration theory, film theory, boundary theory) in coming weeks

## Balance Equations At Interfaces

We now have 2 equations to determine the interfacial concentrations!

1. Equilibrium concentration distribution

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
K = \frac{c_{Li}}{c_i}
\end{align}
```

2. Flux matching

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_{A}\vert_{\text{liq}} &= N_{A}\vert_{\text{gas}} \\
k_{c, \text{liq}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) &= k_{c, \text{gas}} (c_{g, i} - c_{g, b})
\end{align}
```

We can solve $c_{L, i}$ and $c_{g, i}$ given information about:

- Bulk concentrations $c_{L, b}$, $c_{g, b}$
- Equilibrium distribution coefficient $K$
- Mass transfer coefficients $k_c$ in each phase

## Demonstration of Mixed Boundary Conditions

## Summary
In this lecture, we talked about

- The difficulty of studying boundary problems in mass transfer
- The rise of equilibrium distribution coefficient $K$ and mass transfer coefficient $k$
- Link between mass transfer coefficient $k$ and transfer layer

## What To Learn Next

The concept of mass transfer coefficient $k$ is both beautiful and
ugly.

- We **gain** the simplicity of expressing flux equations using simple
formula,
- We **lose** physical understanding about its origin in many systems

In next lectures, we will see:

- How to use mass transfer coefficients for different phases (gas, liquid, solid)
- How convective fluid transport is expressed using coefficients
- How to perform mass transfer analysis based on transfer coefficients
