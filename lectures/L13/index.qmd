# Convective Mass Transfer

## Remaining Questions From Unsteady State Mass Transfer

Our current knowledge cannot answer questions like this:

- If chemical species A is transferred between two difference phases, what is the concentration in each phase?
- How do we solve the mass transfer when $c$ is not uniform? (See long answer question 2)
- What if fluid becomes turbulent?

## What We Want To Solve In Part II: A Real Engineering Problem

You work in a pipeline maintenance team in Enbridge and need to remove a sticky, unwanted coating from the inner wall of a pipeline. There are a few design questions:

- Which flushing liquid works best?
  - solvent / water mixture
  - solubility of the coating
- How fast should the fluid flow?
  - required mean velocity $v_m$
- What concentration remains in the liquid?
  - outlet concentration of the contaminant
- How fast is the coating removed?
  - removal rate vs. $v_m$

**What you want to report:**

- Total volume of flushing liquid required
- Total flushing time to reach acceptable cleanliness

## Mass Transfer Between Phases: Unsteady State Analysis

We will first look at the first problem, $c_A$ between phase
boundaries. This is something we _in theory_ can solve using U.S.S. But what are the boundary conditions?

Question: a polymer membrane of thickness $2Δ$ contains a chemical
with uniform concentration $c_0$ initially. At $t=0$, it is suddenly
submerged into a solution containing the same chemical with concentration $c_1$. The volume of liquid is very large that concentration remains $c_1$ far away from the membrane-liquid interface.
Model the concentration profile $c(z)$ inside the membrane, and calculate the total chemical absorption rate.

## Solving The Polymer Membrane Mass Transfer Problem

Use the standard procedure for the polymer phase, ignore convection inside

$$
D_{AB} \frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2} = \frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
$$

Initial conditions:

- Inside polymer $c_A(z, t=0) = c_0$
- Outside polymer $c_A(z, t=0) = c_1$

Boundary conditions?

- How do we know $c_A(z)$ at the interface?
- They can actually take any value!


## Summary
In this lecture, we talked about

- Solving long-answer questions in midterm
- The difficulty of studying boundary problems in mass transfer
- The rise of equilibrium distribution coefficient $K$ and mass transfer coefficient $k$

## What To Learn Next

- We will introduce the **mass transfer coefficient** $k$ as a general parameter for convective mass transfer

<!-- - The concept of mass transfer coefficient $k$ is both beautiful and -->
<!-- ugly. -->

<!-- - We **gain** the simplicity of expressing flux equations using simple -->
<!-- formula, -->
<!-- - We **lose** physical understanding about its origin in many systems -->

<!-- In next lectures, we will see: -->

- How to use mass transfer coefficients for different phases (gas, liquid, solid)
- How convective fluid transport is expressed using coefficients
- How to perform mass transfer analysis based on transfer coefficients
