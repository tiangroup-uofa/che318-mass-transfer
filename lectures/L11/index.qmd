- Mass balance & flux analysis for catalyst on wall system


## Learning Outcomes {.center}

After today's lecture, you will be able to:

- **Derive** mass balance and flux with reaction terms
- **Identify** B.C. and I.C. for reaction-related problems
- **Apply** simplifications for U.S.S. problems with generation terms


## U.S.S Example 2: Transport Through A Catalyst Wall

**Question**: A gas mixture containing species A flows through a
cylindrical conduit of diameter $D$ with a constant mean velocity
$v_m$. A porous catalytic wall of thickness $\Delta z$ is located at a
fixed axial position inside the conduit. Inside the catalyst region,
species A is consumed by a first-order surface reaction: 

$$ 
r =
k'(c_{A,s} - c_A) 
$$

Assume:

- surface concentration on catalyst, $c_{A,s}$ is constant
- uniform properties in the radial direction
- constant $T$, $P$, and physical properties
- no reaction outside the catalyst region

## Step 1: Mass Balance

Consider a differential gas-phase control volume of thickness $\Delta z$ that intersects the catalytic wall.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{In} - \text{Out} + \text{Generation} &= \text{Accumulation} \\
\\
\frac{\pi D^2}{4}
\left(
N_A\big|_{z}
-
N_A\big|_{z+\Delta z}
\right)
+
\pi D\,\Delta z\,k'\,(c_{A,s}-c_A)
&=
\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\,
\frac{\partial C_A}{\partial t} \\
-\frac{\partial N_A}{\partial z}
+
\frac{4k'}{D}\,(c_{A,s}-c_A)
=
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
\end{align}
```

## Step 2: Coupling With Flux Equation


Use the convection–diffusion flux (constant $v_m$):

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A
=
-\,D_{AB}\,\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial z}
+
c_A\,v_m
\end{align}
```

When $v_m$ is constant, differentiate over $N_A$ becomes:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial N_A}{\partial z}
=
-\,D_{AB}\,\frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2}
+
v_m\,\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial z}
\qquad (v_m=\text{const})
\end{align}
```

## Step 3: General Equation for M.T + Surface Reaction

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&=
-\left(
-\,D_{AB}\,\frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2}
+
v_m\,\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial z}
\right)
+
\frac{4k'}{D}\,(c_{A,s}-c_A) \\
&=
D_{AB}\,\frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2}
-
v_m\,\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial z}
+
\frac{4k}{D}\,(c_{A,s}-c_A)
\end{align}
```

Need:

- initial condition $c_A(z,0)$
- boundary conditions at $z=0$ and $z=L$

Solve:

- analytical (special cases)
- numerical integration (finite difference)

## Simplifications for Solving U.S.S. Problems

We can make some assumptions that do not have significant impact on the results:

- **Assumption 1**: convection $\gg$ diffusion
  - We can write $D_{AB} \frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2} \approx 0$
  - Only need $v_m$ to solve the U.S.S. problem
  - Typically tolerable error in industrial pipes

- **Asumption 2**: system close to steady state
  - U.S.S --> S.S.? Just let $\partial c_A/\partial t = 0$
  - Can compare with other S.S. solutions!


## Solutions to Simplified U.S.S. Governing Equations

After removing the $\partial c_A/\partial t$ and  $D_{AB} \frac{\partial^2 c_A}{\partial z^2}$ terms, we have

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{4k'}{D}\left(c_{AS}-c_A\right)
&= v_m \frac{dc_A}{dz} \\
\int_0^z \frac{4k'}{D v_m} dz
&= \int_{c_{Ai}}^{c_A} \frac{dc_A}{c_{AS}-c_A} \\
\frac{4k'}{D v_m} z &= -\ln\!\left(\frac{c_{AS}-c_A(z)}{c_{AS}-c_{Ai}}\right)
\end{align}
```

We get $c_A(z)$ profile:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
c_A(z)
= c_{AS}
-\left(c_{AS} - c_{Ai}\right)
\exp\!\left(-\frac{4k'}{D_{AB} v_m} z\right)
\end{align}
```

## What Happens To The Solution?

We show previously that steady state solution without generation
**does not** depend on the $D_{AB}$, why do we see the expression
$c_A(z)$ with $D_{AB}$ inside?

- This is the effect of generation term!
- Qualitatively, a generation "source" of A must be exhausted 
  by the molar  flux in the system!
- The concentration after the reaction region decays exponentially
- Length scale $D_{AB} v_m / 4 k'$
- Relation to Damköhler number of reaction-transport system

## Dimensionless Analysis

Reaction-transport Damköhler number:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
Da &= \frac{\text{[reaction rate]}}{\text{[transport rate]}} \\
&= \frac{k' L}{D_{AB} v_m}
\end{align}
```

## Case 3: Catalytic Conversion of D → E (1D, Steady State)

**Question**: A binary gas mixture containing species D and E occupies
a stagnant gas film of thickness $L$ in the $z$-direction.  At $z=0$,
the gas is in contact with a solid catalyst surface that
instantaneously and completely converts D to E.  At $z=L$, the gas
composition is maintained at known values. Assumpt constant $T$ and
total pressure $p_T$ and 100% conversion rate. The reaction between D and E follows:
$$
m \text{D} \rightarrow n \text{E}
$$

Develop the governing differential equation for $N_D$ and $c_D$ the
molar flux of species D in the gas phase.

## Step 1: Mass Balance

At anywhere outside the boundary, we have:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{[In]} - \text{[Out]} + \text{[Gen]} &= \text{[Acc]} \\
-\frac{\partial N_D}{\partial z} + 0 &= \frac{\partial c_D}{\partial t}
\end{align}
```

- Catalyst at the bottom of the reactor 👉 [Gen] = 0
- How do we get the boundary condition?

## Step 2: Flux Equation

The reaction at the bottom catalyst is very fast, we can use the
"general case" flux equation

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_D = -D_{DE} \frac{\partial c_A}{\partial z} + \frac{c_D}{c_T} (N_D + NE)
\end{align}
```

- How do we get relation between $N_D$ and $N_E$?
- What are the boundary conditions?

## Step 3: Conditions And Solutions

We have in general $N_E / m = - N_D / n$

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\left[
-D_{DE} \frac{\partial c_D}{\partial z}
+ \frac{c_D}{c_T} (N_D + N_E)
\right] &= \frac{\partial c_D}{\partial t} \\
-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}
\left[
-D_{DE} \frac{\partial c_D}{\partial z}
+ \frac{c_D}{c_T} N_D (1 - \frac{n}{m})
\right] &= \frac{\partial c_D}{\partial t}
\end{align}
```

The steady state solution can be easily integrated

We will cover until **this point** in the mid-term exam!

To solve unsteady and steady state problem, use the following steps:

1. Draw scheme and list physical quantities / conditions
2. Write mass balance equation
3. Is it steady-state or unsteady-state?
4. If unsteady state, write flux equation in differential form
5. If steady state, use one of the solution examples 
6. Do integration / calculation
