## Recap

- **General solution** for diffusion binary mixture gas systems ($N_B = k N_A$)
  - $k = -1$ reduces to EMCD solution
  - Total flux $N_A$ is EMCD flux times a coefficient
  
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A = \frac{ c_T D_{AB}}{(z_2 - z_1)}
\left(\frac{N_A}{N_A + N_B}\right)
\ln\!\left[\dfrac{
\frac{N_A}{N_A + N_B} - x_{A2}}
{\frac{N_A}{N_A + N_B} - x_{A1}}
\right]
\end{align}
```

## Detailed Explanation for Convection-Driven Flux Change

::: {.callout-note}
Advanced topic, not shown in presentation
:::

The ratio between total flux in general solution $N_A(\text{gen})$ and $N_A(\text{EMCD})$ can be written as:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  \frac{N_A(\text{gen})}{N_A(\text{EMCD})}
  &= \frac{s \ln\! \left[
    \frac{s - x_{A2}}{s - x_{A1}}
    \right]}{x_{A1} - x_{A2}} \\
  &= \frac{s \ln\! \left[
    \frac{s - x_{A2}}{s - x_{A1}}
    \right]}{(s - x_{A2}) - (s - x_{A1})} \\
  &= \frac{s}{\text{LM}(s-x_A)}
\end{align}
```
where $\text{LM}(u)$ is the log-mean function (similar treatment in [Lecture 2](../L02)), and $s = N_A / (N_A + N_B)$.

There are several limiting cases. Let's assume $x_{A1} > x_{A2}$ for simplicity, and there is a real solution to the $N_A(\text{gen})$

1. $s > x_{A1}$:

   $s - x_{A1}$ and $s - x_{A2}$ must be both positive to ensure a
   solution. Therefore $\text{LM}(s-x_A) < s$. We know that
   $N_A(\text{gen})>N_A(\text{EMCD})$.
   
   - Example: diffusion through stagnant B ($s = 1$)
     
	 In this case $\text{LM}(s-x_A) = \text{LM}(x_B)$, we can conclude that the diffusion through stagnant B case **always enhances** total flux compared with EMCD.
	 
	 A signature of such transport is the $x_A(z)$ profile is **concave**, as shown in @fig-na-comp (a).
	 
2. $s < 0$:

   $s - x_{A2}$ and $s - x_{A1}$ are be both negative. Therefore $|\text{LM}(s-x_A)| > s$. We know that
   $N_A(\text{gen})<N_A(\text{EMCD})$, but $N_A$ is still positive.
   
   - Example: counter $N_B$ flux ($N_B/N_A < -1$)
     
	 The opposite direction of $N_B$ **attenuates** the molar flux of A. A signature of such transport is the $x_A(z)$ profile is **convex**, as shown in @fig-na-comp (b).
	 
3. $0 < s < x_2$:

	$s - x_{A2}$ and $s - x_{A1}$ are be both negative. Since $s >0$, we actually can have $N_A < 0$!
	
	Such situation may be counter-intuitive but the solution is physically valid, as the only solution to satisfy such criteria is $N_B < 0$ and $N_A < 0$ at the same time.
	As we cannot directly compare $s$ and $\text{LM}(s-x_A)$ in this case, $|N_A(\text{gen})|$ can be either smaller or larger than $N_A(\text{EMCD})$, as shown in @fig-na-comp (c) and (d).
	
4. $x_2 < s < x_1$:
   
   The expression inside the logarithm is negative and we do not have a real solution to the general equation for $N_A$.

## Learning Outcomes {.center}

After today's lecture, you will be able to:

- **Recall** multiple theories of molecular diffusivity 
- **Analyze** the diffusivity $D_{AB}$ as function of $(T, P)$
- **Derive** new diffusivity values from standard table
- **Formulate** governing equations for different scenarios measuring the diffusivity

---

## Motivation to Have Theory About Diffusivity {.center}

- Solving the general solution for gas mass transfer requires parameter $D_{AB}$ (and $D_{BA}$)!
- Measuring every $D_{AB}$ pair for gases is tedious
- $D_{AB}$ is dependent on conditions $T, P$
- We need to have theories that can **predict** diffusivity $D_{AB}$ **without** doing all pair experiments and all $(T, P)$ conditions!
- In the lease case, the theory should allow extrapolating a measured $D_{AB}(T_1, P_1)$ to $D_{AB}(T_2, P_2)$

## Molecular Diffusivity Theory -- Kinetic Theory

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

$$
D_{AB} = \frac{1}{3} \overline{u} \lambda
$$

- $\overline{u}$: average molecular velocitt
- $\lambda$: mean free path between collisions

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
Assumptions:

- Rigid sphere type molecules (what are they?)
- No interaction upon collisions
- Collisions are elastic 
- Good for dilute gases (low $P$)
- Not accurate otherwise

## Molecular Diffusivity Theory -- Chapman-Enskog Theory

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  D_{AB} &= \frac{1.8583\times{}10^{-7} T^{3/2}}
           {P \sigma_{AB}^2 \Omega_{D, AB}} \left(\frac{1}{m_A} + \frac{1}{m_B} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
 &\propto \frac{T^{\frac{3}{2}}}{P} \left(\frac{1}{m_A} + \frac{1}{m_B} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align}
```
- $m_A$, $m_B$, molecular weight
- $\sigma_{AB}$: average collision radius between A and B
- $\Omega_{D, AB}$: Lennard-Jones collision integral 
  - $\Omega_{D, AB}=1$ for elastic collision
  - Chapman-Enskog theory accounts for non-elastic collision using $\Omega_{D, AB}\neq1$

---

## Molecular Diffusivity Theory -- Fuller Method

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
D_{AB} &= \frac{10^{-7} T^{1.75} }{P \left[ (\sum \nu_A)^{1/3} + (\sum \nu_B)^{1/3}\right]^2}
         \left(\frac{1}{m_A} + \frac{1}{m_B} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
  &\propto \frac{T^{1.75}}{P}
\end{align}
```

- Mainly to overcome the complicated estimation of $\Sigma_{D, AB}$ in Chapman-Enskog Theory
- $\sum \nu_i$ sum of structural volume increments
- $\sum \nu_i$ can be estimated from individual atoms
- Easier to use than the Chapman-Enskog Theory, but less accurate

## How to Use the Fuller Method From a Table

We need to determine $\sum \nu_A$ and $\sum \nu_B$,
*Check Table 6.2-2 of Geankoplis 4th ed*.

- $\sum \nu_i$ are **dimensionless** numbers
- For known gases in the table, use its value in the table
  - Air: $\nu = 20.1$
  - O$_2$:  $\nu = 16.6$
  
- For an unknown gas, use its chemical composition
  - For chemical formula $\text{C}_x \text{H}_y \text{O}_z$,
    $$
	\sum \nu(\text{C}_x \text{H}_y \text{O}_z)
	= \nu(\text{C}) \cdot x + \nu(\text{H}) \cdot y + \nu(\text{O}) \cdot z
	$$

## Estimating $D_{AB}$ At Different $(T, P)$

For the same pair of (A, B), both the Chapman-Enskog and Fuller methods have the same form
$$
D_{AB} \propto \frac{T^n}{P}
$$

This means we can find one existing $D_{AB}$ value from table and extrapolate:
$$
\frac{D_{AB}\vert_1}{D_{AB}\vert_2}
= \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^{n}
\left(
\frac{P_2}{P_1}
\right)
$$

Fuller method is often used in chemical engineering, where $n=1.75$.

# Examples To Solve


## Summary

- Diffusivity $D_{AB}$ value is the key to solve the transport problem in gases
- $D_{AB}$ can be measured from experiments, but not exhaustively
- Several theories predict the value for $D_{AB}$ with certain accuracy
- Chapman-Enkog theory and Fuller method both have $D_{AB}\propto T^n/P$ form
- Fuller method more often used as it can approximate $D_{AB}$ solely by taking values from table
