## Learning Outcomes {.center}

(Continue from Lecture 06) After today's lecture, you will be able to:

- **Identify** the difference between diffusion in various geometries
- **Describe** the approximations used for simplifying the soluton for $N_A$
- **Recall** the reason to choose stagnant B solution for spherical diffusion
- **Solve** pseudo-steady state diffusion problem
- **Analyze** solutions of P.S.S solution and calculate diffusivity through experiment

## Diffusion Through Varying Cross-Sectional Area

**Steady state mass balance**

Many industrial applications involde 1D transport with variable area $A(z)$, with mass balance:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
[\mathrm{In}] - [\mathrm{Out}] &= 0 \\
N_{A1} A_1 - N_{A2} A_2 &= 0
\end{align}
```

Define the **total molar flow rate** of A:

$$
\overline{N}_A = N_A \, A(z)
$$

At steady state:
- $\overline{N}_A$ is constant
- $N_A$ varies with position if $A(z)$ (or $A(r)$) varies

## Applications of Variable-Area Diffusion

![](./public/vary-area.png){width="75%"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
This framework can be used to solve diffusion through:

- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Tube with varying diameter
- Any system with a known area function $A = A(z)$ or $A=A(r)$
:::


:::{.column width="50%"}
**Key ideas**

- Do **not** solve as simple 1D Cartesian diffusion
- Geometry enters through $A(z)$
- Flux adjusts to maintain constant $\overline{N}_A$

## Case Study 1: Diffusion Through a Sphere

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
**Typical physical situations**

- Evaporation of a liquid droplet
- Sublimation of a solid organic sphere
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
**Conditions**

- Steady state
- Stagnant B ($N_B = 0$)
- Radial symmetry
:::
:::

**Governing equation (stagnant B)**: use the **ODE form**, not the full 1D Cartesian solution:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{d p_A}{dr}
      + \frac{p_A}{p_T} N_A \\
N_A\!\left(1 - \frac{p_A}{p_T}\right)
    &= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{d p_A}{dr}
\end{align}
```

## Stagnant B in a Sphere: Reformulation

For spherical symmetry, $N_A(r)$ varies with $r$ and **cannot** appear alone in the balance equation L.H.S

Use the **constant molar flow rate**:
$$
\overline{N}_A = N_A(r)\,4\pi r^2 = \text{constant}
$$

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\overline{N}_A}{4\pi r^2}\,dr
&= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{1}{1-p_A/p_T}\,dp_A
\end{align}
```

## Stagnant B in a Sphere: Final Results

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
\frac{\overline{N}_A}{4\pi} \left(\frac{1}{r_1}-\frac{1}{r_2}\right)
= \frac{D_{AB}p_T}{RT}
\ln\!\left(\frac{p_T-p_{A2}}{p_T-p_{A1}}\right)
}
\end{align}
```

This looks very similar to the 1D stagnant B solution in cartesian
coordinates. We can simplify it in several occations.

## Stagnant B in a Sphere: Far-Field Limit ($r_2 \gg r_1$)

**Special case:** $r_2 \gg r_1$ (often $r_2 \to \infty$)

Typical examples:
- Evaporating liquid droplet
- Sublimation of a naphthalene (solid) sphere

From the general spherical stagnant-B result, use the **log-mean pressure** form:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
N_{A1}
= \frac{D_{AB} p_T}{RT\,p_{Bm}}
\left(p_{A1} - p_{A2}\right)
}
\end{align}
```

Where $N_{A1} = N_A(r=r_1)$. For liquid, another form is often used (considering $p_{Bm}/p_T \approx 1$ and use $p = cRT$)

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
N_{A1} = \frac{D_{AB}}{r_1}\left(c_{A1} - c_{A2}\right)
}
\end{align}
```

## Spherical Diffusion: Thin Shell Limit $r_1 \approx r_2$

**Special case:** thin membrane / shell  
$\Delta r = r_2 - r_1 \ll r_1$

Approximation:
$$
\frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2}
\;\approx\;
\frac{r_2 - r_1}{r_1^2}
\;=\;
\frac{\Delta r}{r_1^2}
$$

Final result:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
N_{A1} = \frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{p_T}{p_{Bm}}
\frac{(p_{A1}-p_{A2})}{\Delta r}
}
\end{align}
```

This acts like a 1D stagnant-B film with thickness $\Delta r$! (See lecture 3 wooclap question.)

## Case 2: Diffusion Through a Non-uniform Area Conduit

Conditions:

- Stagnant B
- Steady state
- Variable radius $r(z)$

Assume **linear radius profile**:
$$
r(z) = r_1 + \frac{(r_2-r_1)}{(z_2-z_1)}(z-z_1)
$$

Use the **ODE form** with $\dot N_A = N_A(z)\,A(z)$ and $A(z)=\pi r(z)^2$:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\dot N_A}{\pi}\int_{z_1}^{z_2}\frac{dz}{\left[r(z)\right]^2}
&= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\int_{p_{A1}}^{p_{A2}}
\frac{dp_A}{1-p_A/p_T}
\end{align}
```

_Can you solve for $N_{A1}$_?

# Examples for Pseudo Steady State (P.S.S)

## Example 1: Diffusion Through Stagnant B with Changing Path Length

_Adapted from Geankoplis 6.2-3_

Water vapor diffuses through a stagnant gas in a narrow vertical tube, dry air is constantly blown at the top of tube.  
At time $t$, the liquid level is a distance $z$ from the tube top (i.e., the diffusion path length is $z$).  
As diffusion proceeds, the liquid level drops slowly, so $z$ increases with time. The liquid has density $\rho_A$, and molecular weight $M_A$

1) Derive an expression for the time $t_F$ required for the level to drop such that the diffusion path length changes from $z=z_0$ at $t=0$ to $z=z_F$ at $t=t_F$.



## Example 1: solutions

:::{.callout-tip}
1. Use pseudo steady-state assumption
2. $N_A$ change over time!
:::

Answer
$$
t_F = \frac{\rho_A (z_F^2 - z_0^2) RT p_{Bm}}{2 D_{AB} M_A p_{T}} \frac{1}{(p_{A1} - p_{A2})}
$$

## Example 2: Determine $D_{AB}$ Through Evaporation

_Adapted from Griskey 10-2_

Sample setup as example 4, a vertical tube of diameter $D=0.01128$ m
contains a liquid volatile species $A$ (chloropicrin, $CCl_3NO_2$)
evaporating into stagnant air ($B$) at 1 atm. The gas-phase
diffusion of $A$ occurs through the air column above the liquid
surface.

At $t=0$, the distance from the tube top to the liquid surface is $z_0 = 0.0388$ m, after $t=1$ day, the distance is $z_1 = 0.0412$ m.

- Vapor pressure at the interface: $p_{A1} = 3178.3$ Pa
- Liquid density: $\rho_A = 1650$ kg/m$^3$
- Molecular weight: $M_A = 164.39$ kg/kmol

1) Use your expression from example 4, determine the binary diffusivity $D_{AB}$ of $A$ in air.

## Example 2: solutions

:::{.callout-tip}
Pseudo steady state solution and assuming $N_A=\text{const}$ solution differ very little. Why?
:::

Answer:

1. Pseudo-steady state: $D_{AB} = 8.56\times{}10^{-6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}$
1. $N_A$ constant: $D_{AB} = 8.75\times{}10^{-6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}$ ($+2.2\%$ error)

## Example 3: P.S.S For Diffusion Through Sphere

_Adapted from Geankoplis Ex 6.2-4_

A sphere of naphthalene having a radius of 2.0 mm is suspended in a large volume of still air at 318 K and
$1.01325 \times{}10^5$ Pa (1 atm). The surface temperature of the naphthalene can be assumed to be at 318 K and
its vapor pressure at 318 K is 0.555 mm Hg. The $D_AB$ of naphthalene in air at 318 K is $6.92\times{}10^{−6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}$.

1. Calculate the rate of evaporation of naphthalene from the surface.
2. Write the expression for the time $t_F$ to evaporate a sphere from radius $r_0$ to $r_F$. The solid density for naphthalene is $\rho$ and molecular weight is $M_A$.
3. What is the $t_F$ value when the sphere is completely evaporated?


## Example 3: solutions

:::{.callout-tip}
Similar setup as example 5. $N_A$ is time-dependent
:::

Answer:

1) $N_A = 9.68\times{}10^{-8}\ \text{kg mol}/\text{m}^2/\text{s}$
2) Expression for $t_F{r=r_F}$:
$$
t_F(r=r_F) = \frac{\rho RT p_{Bm}}{2 M_A D_{AB} p_T} \frac{1}{(p_{A1} - p_{A2})} (r_0^2 - r_F^2)
$$
3) Expression for $t_F{r=0}$:
$$
t_F(r=0) = \frac{\rho RT p_{Bm} r_0^2}{2 M_A D_{AB} p_T} \frac{1}{(p_{A1} - p_{A2})}
$$

Compare the solutions with Example 4. We can also measure the
diffusivity of volatile organic molecules using the sphere evaporation
methos!
