## Learning Outcomes {.center}

After today's lecture, you will be able to:

- **Analyze** time-dependent concentration profiles for U.S.S situations.

## What Is Unsteady-State Mass Transfer?

![](./public/1D-mt.png){width="65%" .center}

```{=tex}
\text{[In]} - \text{[Out]} + \text{[Gen]} = \text{[Acc]}
```

- Concentration varies with time $\partial c/\partial t \neq 0$
- Accumulation term is non-zero $\text{[Acc]} \neq 0$
- Requires time-dependent mass balances
- Common in transient diffusion, start-up, and response problems
- **More general** than S.S.

## Governing Equation for U.S.S M.T.

Consider a control volume in 1D transport, the mass balance equation becomes

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
 \text{[Acc]} &= \text{[In]} - \text{[Out]} + \text{[Gen]} \\
S \Delta z \frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&= S (N_A \vert_{z=z} - N_A \vert_{z=z+\Delta z}) + \text{[Gen]} S \Delta z \\
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&=
-\frac{\partial N_A(z)}{\partial z}\vert_z + r_{A}
\end{align*}
```

where $r_{A}$ is the generation rate for A (e.g. local reaction). 
This is the governing equation for all time-dependent mass transfer!

## Comparison between Flux equation and Mass Balance

#### Flux equation

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
N_A = J_{Az}^* + x_A(N_A + N_B)
\end{align*}
```

- Amount of material moved **in** and **out** of controled volume
- $J_{Az}^*$: Fick's first law of diffusion
- Can be used for S.S ($d N_A/dz = 0$) and U.S.S

:::{.column width="50%"}

#### Mass balance eq

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial N_A}{\partial x} + r_A
\end{align}
```

- Change of local $c_A$ over time
- Need flux equation solution first
- Can be used for S.S ($\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t} = 0$) and U.S.S.

## Mass Balance: Extension to 3D

![Illustration of divergence](./public/divergence-operator.png){width="75%" .center}

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&= r_A
- \frac{\partial N_{Ax}}{\partial x}
- \frac{\partial N_{Ay}}{\partial y}
- \frac{\partial N_{Az}}{\partial z} \\
&= r_A - \nabla \cdot \vec{N}_A
\end{align}
```


- $\nabla \cdot$ is the **divergence** operator (not $\Delta$, not gradient!)
- $\vec{N}_A$ is generally a 3D vector field

## How To Analyze A U.S.S Problem

Unsteady state mass transfer is not intimidating if you follow these steps

1. Draw the scheme
2. Write down the **mass balance** equation ([In] - [Out] + [Gen] = [Acc])
3. Identify the [Gen] and [Acc] terms
4. Choose proper **flux equations** for [In] and [Out] terms
5. Solving analytically or numerically.

## Dissecting the General Equation for Mass Balance

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
r_A - \frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&= \nabla \cdot \left[\vec{J}_{A}^{*} + x_A(\vec{N}_A + \vec{N}_B) \right] \\
&= \nabla \cdot \left[\vec{J}_{A}^{*} + c_A \vec{v}_m \right] \\
&= \nabla \cdot \left[ -D_{AB} \nabla c_A + c_A \vec{v}_m \right]
\end{align*}
```

- We have fluid velocity $\vec{v}_m$ on the R.H.S
- $\nabla \cdot$ creates more nonlinear terms
- Do we know $N_A$ and $N_B$ relation?
- In general this is hard to solve (coupling fluid with mass transfer)
- Often interested in several limiting cases

## Special Cases of Unsteady-State Mass Transfer

- Case 1: EMCD for gases at constant $p_T$, $r_A = 0$ (Fick’s second law)
   - There is **no negative sign** in Fick's second law!
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&=
D_{AB}\nabla^2 c_A
\end{align}
```

- Case 2: Constant $D_{AB}$
```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&=
D_{AB}\nabla^2 c_A
- c_A \nabla \cdot \vec{v}_m
- \vec{v}_m \cdot \nabla c_A
+ r_A
\end{align*}
```


- Case 3: Constant $\rho$ and $D_{AB}$ (e.g. imcompressible liquids)
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
&=
D_{AB}\nabla^2 c_A
- \vec{v}_m \cdot \nabla c_A
+ r_A
\end{align}
```
where $\nabla \cdot \vec{v}_m = 0$

## What exactly do we solve?

For U.S.S M.T, we typically need

1. Governing equation (PDE) from any limiting case
2. Initial conditions $c_A(z, t=0)$
3. Boundary conditions (B.C.)
   - Dirichlet B.C. (e.g. $c_A(z=0) = c_0$)
   - Neumann B.D. (e.g. $N_A(z=0) = N_{A0}$, constant flux)
4. Solving analytically or numerically
5. Get $c_A(z, t)$, $x_A(z, t)$, $N_A(x, t)$
6. Steady-state solutions often means $c_A(z, t\to \infty)$

## Unsteady State Mass Transfer: Calculation Overview

![A "solver engine" for unsteady state mass transfer](./public/uss-engine.png){width="85%"}

## B.C. Case 1. Concentration at surfaces

![Concentration at phase interfaces](./public/bc-conc.svg){width="55%"}

- Interface can be gas|liquid, liquid|solid, gas|solid
- Often assuming equilibrium

$$
c_{A}\vert_{\text{surf}} = c_{As}\qquad\text{eq. solubility}
$$

## B.C. Case 2: Chemical Reactions

![Boundary condition for reaction](./public/bc-reaction.svg){width="55%"}


```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A\big|_{\text{surf}} = \nu_A\, r_A
\end{align}
```

- Surface reaction couples mass transfer and kinetics
- Molar flux at surface determined by reaction rate
- Generally Neumann boundary
- $\nu_A$: stoichiometric ratio

## B.C. Case 3: Constant Flux

![Constant flux B.C.](./public/const-flux-bc.svg){width="55%"}

- In many cases the flux $N_{A, \text{surf}}$ or $N_{B, \text{surf}}$ can be constant.
- E.g. inpenetratable surface to stagnant gas $N_{B, \text{surf}} = 0$
- **Does not** mean $N_{A}(z)$ or $N_B(z)$ elsewhere is constant!

## U.S.S Example 1: Diffusion Through Stagnant B

We have seen in previous examples how to solve the molar flux of
liquid evaporating into stagnant air. Let's see the same system but in unsteady state.

**Question**: liquid methanol (A) evaporates inside stagnant air (B)
inside a vertical tube at constant temperature $T$ and pressure
$p_T$. At the vent of the system dry air is continuous blown. Plot the
molar fraction $x_A$ as a function of $z$ and time $t$. Assume the liquid level is $z_0$ away from the vent and does not change during the evaporation process.

## Step 1: Species Mass Balance (Unsteady, 1D)

For a differential slice $A\,dz$, write the mass balance

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{[IN]} - \text{[OUT]} &= \text{[ACC]} \\
A N_A \vert_{z=z} - A N_A \vert_{z=z+\Delta z}
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(A\,dz\,c_A\right) \\
-\frac{\partial N_A}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial c_A}{\partial t}
\end{align}
```

We would have $\frac{\partial c_B}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial N_B}{\partial z}$

## Step 2: Couple With Flux Equation

This is a diffusion through stagnant B case, we can directly write

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A(z, t) = -c_T D_{AB}\frac{\partial x_A(z, t)}{\partial z} + x_A \left[N_A(z, t) + N_B(z, t)\right]
\end{align}
```

- Can we use $N_B=0$ in this case?
- **No**, $N_B$ changes by $z, t$!
- $N_B=0$ only at $z=0$ (liquid interface)
- **Do not** write the steady state $N_A$ solution!

## Step 3: Conservation Equations

Generally, we still need to know the relation between $N_A$ and $N_B$
to solve the mass-balance-flux equations.

The total concentration $c_T=c_A + c_B$ is conserved, therefore we have constrains

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{[In]}_{T} - \text{[Out]}_{T} &= 0 \\
\text{[In]}_A - \text{[Out]}_A &= -\text{[In]}_B + \text{[Out]}_B \\
\frac{\partial N_A(z, t)}{\partial z} &= -\frac{\partial N_B(z, t)}{\partial z}
\end{align}
```

## Step 4: Boundary Conditions

Boundary conditions (Left, Right, any time)

- $x_A(0, t) = x_{A0}$ (equilibrium vapor fraction)
- $x_A(L, t) = 0$      (dry air)
- $N_B(0, t) = 0$  (No-flux boundary for B)

The last B.C for $N_B(0, t)$ gives:
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A(0, t) = -\frac{c_T D_{AB}}{1 - x_{A0}}\frac{\partial x_A(0, t)}{\partial z}
\end{align}
```

## Step 5: Final solution

- Unsteady state flux equation (stagnant B)

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A = -c_T D_{AB} \frac{\partial x_A}{\partial z}
+ x_A \left[ \frac{-c_T D_{AB}}{1 - x_{A0}} \frac{\partial x_{A}}{\partial z}\big\vert_{z=0} \right]
\end{align}
```

- Governing equation for diffusion through stagnant B, unsteady state:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial x_A}{\partial t}
= c_T D_{AB} \frac{\partial^2 x_A}{\partial z^2}
+ \left[ \frac{-c_T D_{AB}}{1 - x_{A0}} \frac{\partial x_{A}}{\partial z}\big\vert_{z=0} \right] \frac{\partial x_A}{\partial z} 
\end{align}
```

- Analytical solution exists, but numerical solution is more convenient

## U.S.S Example 2: Transport Through A Catalyst Wall

**Question**: A gas mixture containing species A flows through a cylindrical conduit of diameter $D$ with a constant mean velocity $v_m$. A porous catalytic wall of thickness $\Delta z$ is located at a fixed axial position inside the conduit. Inside the catalyst region, species A is consumed by a first-order surface reaction:
$$
r = k'(c_{A,s} - c_A)
$$

Assume:
- one-dimensional transport in the axial ($z$) direction
- uniform properties in the radial direction
- constant $T$, $P$, and physical properties
- no reaction outside the catalyst region
