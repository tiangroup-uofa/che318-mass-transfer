## Recap {.center}

- Introduction to mass transfer coefficients
- Link between mass transfer coefficient and diffusivity
- Introduction to boundary concentration problem


## Learning Outcomes {.center}

After today's lecture, you will be able to:

- Remember the flux equations using mass transfer coefficient in different phases
- Recall the motivation of using mass transfer coefficient
- Analyze mass transfer coefficients' units
- Distinguish between mass transfer coefficients in different forms

## Realistic Interfacial Concentration Profiles

At the boundary, it is often convenient to use the equilibrium
concentration ratio between gas ($c_i$) and liquid ($c_{Li}$). This constant, often called the **equilibrium distribution coefficient**, is defined as:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
K &= \frac{\text{[Conc. at gas side]}}{\text{[Conc. at liquid side]}} \\
&= \frac{c_{i}}{c_{Li}}
\end{align}
```

- Similarity: Henry's law ($H = \dfrac{p_{\text{gas}}}{c_{\text{aq}}}$), remember in gas $p_{\text{gas}} = c_{\text{gas}} RT$
- We have already seen similar concepts in solubility in liquid / solid diffusion equations!
- $K$ can be a value range from $0$ to $\infty$ 👉 what does that mean?

## Interfacial Concentration Profile For Different $K$

- The interfacial concentration values depend on the value of $K$!
- What else determines the interfacial balance? 👉 matching of interfacial fluxes $N_A$ at both sides!

## Match of Interfacial Fluxes

**At equilibrium**, if there is no resistance when transferring A between the interface, what is the mass balance equation?

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{[In]}\vert_{\text{left}} - \text{[Out]}\vert_{\text{right}} + \text{[Gen]}\vert_{\text{interface}}
&= \text{[Acc]}\vert_{\text{interface}} \\
N_A\vert_{\text{left}} = N_A\vert_{\text{right}}
\end{align}
```

How do we model $N_A$ in each phase?

- May be a combination of diffusion and convection
- Fluid velocity at interface may be turbulent (hard to model)
- In general we use the phenomenal relation $\text{[Flux]} = \text{[Driving Force]} / \text{[Resistance]}$


## General Flux Equation For Convective Transport Regime

- The driving force is the concentration difference "bulk concentration" and "interfacial concentration"
- The resistance is lumped into one coefficient $k_c'$, **mass transfer coefficient**.

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A = k_c' (c_{L, b} - c_{Li})
\end{align}
```
- $k_c'$ is inversely related to the resistance.
- $k_c'$ means driving force is concentration & convection term is EMCD-like
- The unit of $k_c'$?  👉  $\text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$
- $k_c'$ can be $\infty$! 👉 No transfer resistance inside the bulk phase

## Where Does $k_c'$ Come From (I)?

Simplified view: transport resistance of A from bulk to the interface occurs inside an interfacial film with thickness
$\delta$. We can write $N_A$ at steady state using already known results

- Case 1: EMCD / diffusion-controlled / dilute transport in liquid

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{D_{AB}}{\delta}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c' (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

- Case 2: transport in stagnant film with non-negligible convection

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{D_{AB}}{\delta (1 - \frac{c}{c_T} )}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c' \frac{1}{x_{Bm}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
	&= k_c (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

- Can be written both by $k_c'$ or $k_c$ terms
- One can expect $k_c$ contain the $1/x_{Bm}$ term!

## Where Does $k_c$ Come From (II)?

The mass transfer coefficient $k_c$ is even valid for systems with effective $D_{AB}$!

- Case 3: mass transfer in porous solid materials

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{\epsilon}{\tau}\frac{D_{AB}}{\delta}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c' (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

- Case 4: turbulent mass transfer

The turbulence in the fluid contributes to an additional term $\epsilon_m$ in diffusion terms

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \boxed{\frac{D_{AB} + \epsilon_m}{\delta}} (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) \\
    &= k_c' (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i})
\end{align}
```

- $\epsilon_m$ is the "Eddie diffusivity" (correction to $D_{AB}$ due to turbulence)
- General case for $\epsilon_m$ is non-trivial to solve!

## Implications of Mass Transfer Coefficient $k_c'$

- Really convenient to use! 
- In reality, $k_c'$ is not a physics-based quantity, it depends on system / condition
- $k_c' \propto D_{AB}^n$ in realistic systems
- We will discuss about different theories that explains the relation between $k_c'$ and $D_{AB}$ (penetration theory, film theory, boundary theory) in coming weeks

## Balance Equations At Interfaces

We now have 2 equations to determine the interfacial concentrations!

1. Equilibrium concentration distribution

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
K = \frac{c_{g,i}}{c_{L,i}}
\end{align}
```

2. Flux matching

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_{A}\vert_{\text{liq}} &= N_{A}\vert_{\text{gas}} \\
k_{c, \text{liq}}' (c_{L, b} - c_{L, i}) &= k_{c, \text{gas}}' (c_{g, i} - c_{g, b})
\end{align}
```

We can solve $c_{L, i}$ and $c_{g, i}$ given information about:

- Bulk concentrations $c_{L, b}$, $c_{g, b}$
- Equilibrium distribution coefficient $K$
- Mass transfer coefficients $k_c$ in each phase

## Demonstration of Mixed Boundary Conditions


## Mass Transfer Coefficient In Different Forms

When using $k$ to express flux, we have the **same form** (_Geankoplis Table 7.2.1_)

- Flux equations for EMCD

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{Gases:}\quad 
N_A 
&= k_c'\,(c_{A1}-c_{A2})
= k_G'\,(p_{A1}-p_{A2})
= k_y'\,(y_{A1}-y_{A2})
\\
\text{Liquids:}\quad 
N_A 
&= k_c'\,(c_{A1}-c_{A2})
= k_L'\,(c_{A1}-c_{A2})
= k_x'\,(x_{A1}-x_{A2})
\end{align}
```

- Flux equations for diffusion through stagnant B

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\text{Gases:}\quad 
N_A 
&= k_c\,(c_{A1}-c_{A2})
= k_G\,(p_{A1}-p_{A2})
= k_y\,(y_{A1}-y_{A2})
\\[4pt]
\text{Liquids:}\quad 
N_A 
&= k_c\,(c_{A1}-c_{A2})
= k_L\,(c_{A1}-c_{A2})
= k_x\,(x_{A1}-x_{A2})
\end{align}
```

But:

- $k_c'$ and $k_c$ are two different coefficients
- $k_c'$, $k_L'$, $k_G'$ have different units

## Naming Convention and Units

## Example 1: Convective Flux Through A Tube


Question: Consider steady-state, one-dimensional mass transfer of a
binary gas mixture consisting of species $A$ and $B$ between two
parallel planes, labeled (1) and (2). The total pressure of the system
is $p_T = 700\ \text{kPa}$ and the temperature is maintained at $T =
100 ^\circ\text{C}$. The gas-phase mass transfer coefficient from molar fraction is 
$k_y’ = 1.5 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{kg mol}\cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$. Flow in pipe 1 contains 65 mol% A, while flow in pipe 2 contains 45 mol% B.

1. Find the values for fluxes $N_A$ and $N_B$
2. Find the values (and units) for other coefficients $k_G'$ and $k_c'$


## Solutions To Example 1

:::{.callout-tip}
- Mass transport normal to fluid can usually use $k$ to write the flux equation
- Pay attention to the unit used
:::

Answer

1. $N_A = -N_B = 3.0\times 10^{-5}\ \text{kg mol}\cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$
2. $k_G' = k_y' / p_T = 2.14\times 10^{-7}\ \text{kg mol}/(\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s} \cdot {kPa})$
3. $k_c' = k_y' RT / p_T = 6.65\times 10^{-4}\ \text{m}\cdot \text{s}^{-1}$

## Example 2: Using $k$ For Diffusion Through Stagnant Film

_Geankoplis Ex 7.2-1_ A large volume of pure gas $B$ at 2 atm pressure
flows over a flat surface. Species $A$ is vaporizing from the surface
into the gas stream. The liquid $A$ completely wets the surface of a
blotting paper, so that the interface is always covered with liquid
$A$. The partial pressure of species $A$ at $298\;\text{K}$ is
$0.20\;\text{atm}$. 
From textbook table, 
$$ k_y' = 6.78 \times 10^{-5} \;\frac{\text{kg mol}}{\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}}$$.

Calculate the evaporation rate $N_A$ and determine the values of the gas-phase mass transfer coefficients $k_y$ and $k_G$ for this system.

## Solutions To Example 2

:::{.callout-tip}
- This is a diffusion through stagnant B system
- Convert $k_y'$ to $k_y$ in stagnant B system first
- Express $k_G$ in $\text{kg mol}/(\text{s} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{atm})$ first
:::

Answer

1. $y_{Bm} = 0.95$  👉 
$k_y = k_y'/y_{Bm} = 7.138\times 10^{-5} \;\frac{\text{kg mol}}{\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}}$
2. $y_G = 3.569 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{kg mol}/(\text{s} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{atm})$
3. $N_A = y_G (p_{A1} - p_{A2}) = 7.138 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{kg mol}\cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$

## Example 3: Measuring $k$ For Actual Systems

Since we have $\text{[Flux]} = k \times \text{[Driving Force]}$, we can measure $k$ using given geometries.

Question: solid benzoic acid (A) in a sphere with radius $r_0$ was
place in a tube with water flowing in the system. The fluid was turned
on for a certain time interval $\Delta t$ to remove dissolved A from
the liquid. The masses of a dried sphere before and after the
experiment were measured to be $m_1$ and $m_2$ ($m_2 - m_1 \ll
m_1$). The solubility of A in water is $c_{As}$ and water contain no
benzoid acid. Calculate the mass transfer coefficient of this
system. What form of $k$ did you use?

## Solutions To Example 3

:::{.callout-tip}
- Flow-induced flux, can be turbulent  👉 lumped $k_L$ term is valid
- Link $N_A$ to mass loss rate
:::

Answer:

- Relating flux equation to mass loss rate:
```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= \frac{1}{4 \pi r_0^2} \frac{m_1 - m_2}{M_A \Delta t} \\
&= k_L (c_{As} - 0)
\end{align}
```
- Solve for $k_L$:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
k_L = \frac{1}{4 \pi r_0^2} \frac{m_1 - m_2}{c_{As} M_A \Delta t}
\end{align}
```


## Summary
In this lecture, we talked about

- The difficulty of studying boundary problems in mass transfer
- The rise of equilibrium distribution coefficient $K$ and mass transfer coefficient $k$
- Link between mass transfer coefficient $k$ and transfer layer

## What To Learn Next

The concept of mass transfer coefficient $k$ is both beautiful and
ugly.

- We **gain** the simplicity of expressing flux equations using simple
formula,
- We **lose** physical understanding about its origin in many systems

In next lectures, we will see:

- How to use mass transfer coefficients for different phases (gas, liquid, solid)
- How convective fluid transport is expressed using coefficients
- How to perform mass transfer analysis based on transfer coefficients
