## Key Concepts of Mass Transfer

- **Q: What is mass transfer about**?
  - Moving of chemical species through space

- **Q: What does mass transfer study**?
  - How fast can we move chemicals / materials through space --> Concept of flux
  - What drives species to move? --> Concept of driving force / concentration gradient
  - Resistance of species moving during transport --> Concept of Diffusivity
  - Slow vs fast ways to move species --> diffusion vs convection
  
- **Q: What systems do we study?**
  - Steady state: concentration of species **do not change** over time
  - Unsteady state: concentration of species **change** over time

# Sample Questions (2019)

- Please check our Canvas examples for solutions. 
- We will give a few "what do we look for" and "potential pitfalls"
- Always remember to draw the diagram and list conditions!

## Short Answer Question

![](./public/sa-1.png){width="100%"}

## Short Answer Question 1 -- Key Points

- Surface area of droplet -- sphere -- $4 \pi r_0^2$
- Total flux per droplet -- $\overline{N}_A = 4 \pi r_0^2 N_A$ (bonus: the flux is described by stagnant B solution)
- Relation between surface flux $N_A \propto r_0^{-1}$ 
- Number of droplets $n \propto r_0^{-3}$
- Total mass transfer for same weight: $\propto r_0^{-2}$

Conclusion: 
- smaller particle $r_0$  👉 larger combined area 👉 larger total flux / amount of absorption
- (bonus) in practice you want to balance between making smaller droplets, and energy cost for producing the droplets

## Long Answer Question 1

![](./public/la-1.png){width="100%"}

## Long Answer Question 1 -- Key Points

- Sign in $N_A$ or $J_{Az}^*$
- EMCD situation
- Use Fuller method to calibrate $D_{AB}$ ($\propto T^{1.5}/P$)

## Long Answer Question 2

![](./public/la-2.png){width="100%"}

## Long Answer Question 2 -- Key Points

- Diagram (a cylinder with in/out diameter & length)
- Solid diffusion 👉 EMCD-like equation (diffusion only)
- **DO NOT** write $N_A \propto 1/(d_2 - d_1)$!
- Steady state flux eq. in cylindrical coordinate
- Governing eq for cylindrical coordinate
- Use of $\overline{N}_A$ for steady state
- $c_A$ from solubility


## Long Answer Question 3

![](./public/la-3.png){width="100%"}

## Long Answer Question 3 -- Key Points

- Diagram (convection in axial / z-axis; diffusion in radial / r-axis)
- Mass balance in control volume
- Generation term link to flux-controlled consumption
- Flux boundary conditions in r-axis

## Summary

- Good luck with the midterm exam!
