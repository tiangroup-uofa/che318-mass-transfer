## Key Concepts of Mass Transfer

- **Q: What is mass transfer about**?
  - Moving of chemical species through space

- **Q: What does mass transfer study**?
  - How fast can we move chemicals / materials through space --> Concept of flux
  - What drives species to move? --> Concept of driving force / concentration gradient
  - Resistance of species moving during transport --> Concept of Diffusivity
  - Slow vs fast ways to move species --> diffusion vs convection
  
- **Q: What systems do we study?**
  - Steady state: concentration of species **do not change** over time
  - Unsteady state: concentration of species **change** over time
