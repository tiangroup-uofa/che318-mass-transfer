# Examples for Diffusion in Liquid and Solid

## Example 1: gas diffusion through liquid film

_Adapted from Geankoplis Problem 6.3-2_

Diffusion of Ammonia in an Aqueous Solution. An ammonia (A)–water (B)
solution at 278 K and 4.0 mm thick is in contact at one surface with
an organic liquid at this interface. The concentration of ammonia in
the organic phase is held constant and is such that the equilibrium
concentration of ammonia in the water at this surface is 2.0 wt % ammonia (density of aqueous solution 991.7 kg/m3) and the
concentration of ammonia in water at the other end of the film 4.0 mm
away is 10 wt % (density 961.7 kg/m3). Water and the organic are
insoluble in each other. The diffusion coefficient of NH3 in water is
$1.24\times{}10^{−9}$ m$^2$/s.

a. At steady state, calculate the flux $N_A$ in kg mol/s·m$^2$
b. Calculate the flux $N_B$. Explain.

## Example 1: solutions

See [handwritten notes](./public/L06_annotated.pdf) for step-by-step solutions.

:::{.callout-tip}
1. Determine the type of system if water-organic layer is inpenetratable (answer question b first)
2. Refere to [Lecture 1](../L01) for conversion between wt%, molar fraction and concentration.
:::

Answer:

a. $N_A = 1.52\times{}10^{6}\ \text{kg mol}\cdot\text{m}^{-2}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$
b. $N_B=0$ (diffusion through stagnant film)

## Example 2: diffusion through solid film (solubility)

_Adapted from Geankoplis Problem 6.5-1_

A flat plug 30 mm thick having an area of $4.0\times10^{−4}\
\text{m}^2$ and made of vulcanized rubber is used for closing an
opening in a container. The gas CO2 at 25 °C and 2.0 atm pressure is
inside the container. Calculate the total leakage or diffusion of
CO2 through the plug to the outside in kg mol CO2/s at steady
state. Assume that the partial pressure of CO2 outside is zero. From
Barrer (B5) the solubility of the CO2 gas is 0.90 $m^3$ gas (at STP of
0°C and 1 atm) per m3 rubber per atm pressure of CO2. The diffusivity
is $0.11\times{}10^{−9}$ m$^22$/s.

## Example 2: solution

:::{.callout-tip}
1. Notice the unit for symbols when applying $c_A = S P_A / (22.414)$
2. What unit should **total leakage** have?
:::

Answer:

a. Total leakage rate $1.178\times{}10^{-13}\ \text{kg mol}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$


## Example 3: use of permeability

_Adapted from Geankoplis Problem 6.5-3_

The gas hydrogen
is diffusing through a sheet of vulcanized rubber 20 mm thick at
25 °C. The partial pressure of H2 is 1.5 atm inside and 0 outside.
Using the data from Table 6.5-1 (see below), calculate the following:

a. The diffusivity $D_AB$ from the permeability $P_M$ and solubility $S$ ,
and compare with the value in the table.
b. The flux $N_A$ of H2 at steady state.

## Example 3: solution

Answer:

a. Use $D_{AB} = P_M / S$ (note the unit)
b. $N_A = 1.144\times{}10^{-10}\ \text{kg mol}\cdot\text{m}^{-2}\cdot\text{s}^{-1}$

# Solving Diffusion Through Varying Area

## Diffusion Through Varying Cross-Sectional Area

**Steady state mass balance**

Many industrial applications involde 1D transport with variable area $A(z)$, with mass balance:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
[\mathrm{In}] - [\mathrm{Out}] &= 0 \\
N_{A1} A_1 - N_{A2} A_2 &= 0
\end{align}
```

Define the **total molar flow rate** of A:

$$
\overline{N}_A = N_A \, A(z)
$$

At steady state:
- $\overline{N}_A$ is constant
- $N_A$ varies with position if $A(z)$ (or $A(r)$) varies

## Applications of Variable-Area Diffusion

![](./public/vary-area.png){width="75%"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
This framework can be used to solve diffusion through:

- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Tube with varying diameter
- Any system with a known area function $A = A(z)$ or $A=A(r)$
:::


:::{.column width="50%"}
**Key ideas**

- Do **not** solve as simple 1D Cartesian diffusion
- Geometry enters through $A(z)$
- Flux adjusts to maintain constant $\overline{N}_A$
:::
:::

## Case Study 1: Diffusion Through a Sphere

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
**Typical physical situations**

- Evaporation of a liquid droplet
- Sublimation of a solid organic sphere
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
**Conditions**

- Steady state
- Stagnant B ($N_B = 0$)
- Radial symmetry
:::
:::

**Governing equation (stagnant B)**: use the **ODE form**, not the full 1D Cartesian solution:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
N_A &= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{d p_A}{dr}
      + \frac{p_A}{p_T} N_A \\
N_A\!\left(1 - \frac{p_A}{p_T}\right)
    &= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{d p_A}{dr}
\end{align}
```

## Stagnant B in a Sphere: Reformulation

For spherical symmetry, $N_A(r)$ varies with $r$ and **cannot** appear alone in the balance equation L.H.S

Use the **constant molar flow rate**:
$$
\overline{N}_A = N_A(r)\,4\pi r^2 = \text{constant}
$$

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\overline{N}_A}{4\pi r^2}\,dr
&= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{1}{1-p_A/p_T}\,dp_A
\end{align}
```

## Stagnant B in a Sphere: Final Results

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
\frac{\overline{N}_A}{4\pi} \left(\frac{1}{r_1}-\frac{1}{r_2}\right)
= \frac{D_{AB}p_T}{RT}
\ln\!\left(\frac{p_T-p_{A2}}{p_T-p_{A1}}\right)
}
\end{align}
```

This looks very similar to the 1D stagnant B solution in cartesian
coordinates. We can simplify it in several occations.

## Stagnant B in a Sphere: Far-Field Limit ($r_2 \gg r_1$)

**Special case:** $r_2 \gg r_1$ (often $r_2 \to \infty$)

Typical examples:
- Evaporating liquid droplet
- Sublimation of a naphthalene (solid) sphere

From the general spherical stagnant-B result, use the **log-mean pressure** form:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
N_{A1}
= \frac{D_{AB} p_T}{RT\,p_{Bm}}
\left(p_{A1} - p_{A2}\right)
}
\end{align}
```

Where $N_{A1} = N_A(r=r_1)$. For liquid, another form is often used (considering $p_{Bm}/p_T \approx 1$ and use $p = cRT$)

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
N_{A1} = \frac{D_{AB}}{r_1}\left(c_{A1} - c_{A2}\right)
}
\end{align}
```

## Spherical Diffusion: Thin Shell Limit $r_1 \approx r_2$

**Special case:** thin membrane / shell  
$\Delta r = r_2 - r_1 \ll r_1$

Approximation:
$$
\frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2}
\;\approx\;
\frac{r_2 - r_1}{r_1^2}
\;=\;
\frac{\Delta r}{r_1^2}
$$

Final result:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\boxed{
N_{A1} = \frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\frac{p_T}{p_{Bm}}
\frac{(p_{A1}-p_{A2})}{\Delta r}
}
\end{align}
```

This acts like a 1D stagnant-B film with thickness $\Delta r$! (See lecture 3 wooclap question.)

## Case 2: Diffusion Through a Non-uniform Area Conduit

Conditions:

- Stagnant B
- Steady state
- Variable radius $r(z)$

Assume **linear radius profile**:
$$
r(z) = r_1 + \frac{(r_2-r_1)}{(z_2-z_1)}(z-z_1)
$$

Use the **ODE form** with $\dot N_A = N_A(z)\,A(z)$ and $A(z)=\pi r(z)^2$:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
\frac{\dot N_A}{\pi}\int_{z_1}^{z_2}\frac{dz}{\left[r(z)\right]^2}
&= -\frac{D_{AB}}{RT}\int_{p_{A1}}^{p_{A2}}
\frac{dp_A}{1-p_A/p_T}
\end{align}
```

_Can you solve for $N_{A1}$_?

# Examples for Pseudo Steady State (P.S.S)

## Example 4: Diffusion Through Stagnant B with Changing Path Length

_Adapted from Geankoplis 6.2-3_

Water vapor diffuses through a stagnant gas in a narrow vertical tube, dry air is constantly blown at the top of tube.  
At time $t$, the liquid level is a distance $z$ from the tube top (i.e., the diffusion path length is $z$).  
As diffusion proceeds, the liquid level drops slowly, so $z$ increases with time. The liquid has density $\rho_A$, and molecular weight $M_A$

1) Derive an expression for the time $t_F$ required for the level to drop such that the diffusion path length changes from $z=z_0$ at $t=0$ to $z=z_F$ at $t=t_F$.



## Example 4: solutions

:::{.callout-tip}
1. Use pseudo steady-state assumption
2. $N_A$ change over time!
:::

Answer
$$
t_F = \frac{\rho_A (z_F^2 - z_0^2) RT p_{Bm}}{2 D_{AB} M_A p_{T}} \frac{1}{(p_{A1} - p_{A2})}
$$

## Example 5: Determine $D_{AB}$ Through Evaporation

_Adapted from Griskey 10-2_

Sample setup as example 4, a vertical tube of diameter $D=0.01128$ m
contains a liquid volatile species $A$ (chloropicrin, $CCl_3NO_2$)
evaporating into stagnant air ($B$) at 1 atm. The gas-phase
diffusion of $A$ occurs through the air column above the liquid
surface.

At $t=0$, the distance from the tube top to the liquid surface is $z_0 = 0.0388$ m, after $t=1$ day, the distance is $z_1 = 0.0412$ m.

- Vapor pressure at the interface: $p_{A1} = 3178.3$ Pa
- Liquid density: $\rho_A = 1650$ kg/m$^3$
- Molecular weight: $M_A = 164.39$ kg/kmol

1) Use your expression from example 4, determine the binary diffusivity $D_{AB}$ of $A$ in air.

## Example 5: solutions

:::{.callout-tip}
Pseudo steady state solution and assuming $N_A=\text{const}$ solution differ very little. Why?
:::

Answer:

1. Pseudo-steady state: $D_{AB} = 8.56\times{}10^{-6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}$
1. $N_A$ constant: $D_{AB} = 8.75\times{}10^{-6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}$ ($+2.2\%$ error)

## Example 6: P.S.S For Diffusion Through Sphere

_Adapted from Geankoplis Ex 6.2-4_

A sphere of naphthalene having a radius of 2.0 mm is suspended in a large volume of still air at 318 K and
$1.01325 \times{}10^5$ Pa (1 atm). The surface temperature of the naphthalene can be assumed to be at 318 K and
its vapor pressure at 318 K is 0.555 mm Hg. The $D_AB$ of naphthalene in air at 318 K is $6.92\times{}10^{−6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}$.

1. Calculate the rate of evaporation of naphthalene from the surface.
2. Write the expression for the time $t_F$ to evaporate a sphere from radius $r_0$ to $r_F$. The solid density for naphthalene is $\rho$ and molecular weight is $M_A$.
3. What is the $t_F$ value when the sphere is completely evaporated?


## Example 6: solutions

:::{.callout-tip}
Similar setup as example 5. $N_A$ is time-dependent
:::

Answer:

1) $N_A = 9.68\times{}10^{-8}\ \text{kg mol}/\text{m}^2/\text{s}$
2) Expression for $t_F{r=r_F}$:
$$
t_F(r=r_F) = \frac{\rho RT p_{Bm}}{2 M_A D_{AB} p_T} \frac{1}{(p_{A1} - p_{A2})} (r_0^2 - r_F^2)
$$
3) Expression for $t_F{r=0}$:
$$
t_F(r=0) = \frac{\rho RT p_{Bm} r_0^2}{2 M_A D_{AB} p_T} \frac{1}{(p_{A1} - p_{A2})}
$$

Compare the solutions with Example 4. We can also measure the
diffusivity of volatile organic molecules using the sphere evaporation
methos!
