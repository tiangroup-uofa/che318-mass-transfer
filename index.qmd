## Course Information

- **Course Number**: CHE 318
- **Instructor**: Dr. Tian Tian
- **Semester**: Winter 2026
- **Office**: DICE 12-245
- **Office Hour**: Wednesday 11:15 - 12: 15

## Course Description

Mass transfer fundamentals with emphasis on diffusion, convection, theories of molecular diffusion coefficients, phase equilibria,
and applications to separations and
reactor/transport problems. 

Topics include:

1) molecular diffusion and convection
2) theoretical background of mass transfer coefficients
3) interphase mass transfer, boundary layers
4) analogies with
heat/momentum transfer
5) introductory design calculations for
separation processes.

## Lecture Notes

Thanks to recent developments in scientific typesetting and
interactive computing enabled by tools such as
[**Quarto**](https://quarto.org) and
[**Marimo**](https://docs.marimo.io), the course materials are
presented in different ways. You can view the course notes in the following ways:

- Directly browsing the webpage of individual lectures
- Open the slide presentations for lectures (powered by `reveal.js`)

In either way we have included interactive demonstrations of some
numerical solution to a few key problems, and we hope you enjoy
reading and interacting with the course materials!
